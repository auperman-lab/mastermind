# Mastermind

This is a bonus task for laboratory on Discrete Math class. I did it to familiarise with pygame and python enviroment, get used to allocation of space and just because i was bored. The task is to recreate a classical game for deduction - MasterMind(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) with interface.

Since it is an old game i decided that creating the design in a pixelated way would be iconic.I draw pixelated circles from rectangles , create shaped borders, and used 'PixelEmulator' font to redo vintage athmosphere.
