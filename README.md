# mastermind
  This is a bonus task for laboratory on Discrete Math class. I did it to familiarise with pygame and python enviroment, get used to allocation of space and just because i was bored.
  The task is to recreate a classical game for deduction -  "mastermind"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) with interface. Since it is an old game i decided that creating the design in a pixelated way would be iconic. I draw pixelated circles from rectangles , create shaped borders, and used 'PixelEmulator' font to redo vintage athmosphere. There are 2 game modes: Automatic(cypher gets generated randomly) and Manual(cypher enters the second player).

  Also i developed the ancestor of this game "bulls and cows"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows) for practice before actually doing Master Mind.
